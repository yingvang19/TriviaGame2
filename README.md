# Marvel Trivia Game
This Game uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Jquery.
This trivia game shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or until the time runs out. If the player selects the correct answer, it shows a screen congratulating the player, and if the player runs out of time, it will tell the player that time is up and display the correct answer. On the final screen, it will show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, unanswered, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page). Have fun and enjoy the game.
